## Project Overview.
In this project, I applied various data preprocessing steps and trained a machine learning model to predict target outcomes. the main objective is to demonstrate the end-to-end ML workflow.


# what this Project is going to be about.

This is used to predict student performance by looking at different factors. It includes details like a studentâ€™s gender, race or ethnicity, their parents' education level, whether they get free or reduced-price lunch, and if they took a test preparation course. It also has their scores in math, reading, and writing. By studying these details, the goal is to understand what might affect student scores and help find ways to improve academic results.

### Key Steps
- Data Cleaning

- Feature Engineering

- Model Selection

- Hyperparameter Tuning

- Model Evaluation


## Create and activate a virtual environment 

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`



## Install required packages

pip install -r requirements.txt
